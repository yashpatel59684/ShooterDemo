# ShooterDemo

Open the scene from the build setting.
Created windows biuld also if you want to play directly.

1. created prefab of square "Float" and added script, twick with parameters to see changes. there is rotation bool to perfom rotation and give effect like ship is in the see and its floating on water with the wave rotation.
2. Created glow effect using material and postprocessing, its is not accurate as i expect but its nearly the same.
3. I created the shooting demo using New input system.
